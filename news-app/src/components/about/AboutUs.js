            News websites are sites devoted to delivering the news in a
            different format than television, print or radio. News sites include
            sites that have a large variety of information which may not be
            considered "news" by all audiences, but may include entertainment,
            games, news that may not be current but is interesting, or other
            miscellaneous information.Writing for a news website is similar to
            writing news in other mediums, but the handling of the website is
            different. The writing still needs to be concise and direct, if not
            more than other news because there is more to pull the reader's
            attention to other articles, or even other sites than a print or
            television medium. The site would probably still be organized with
            the big story on the top or the biggest section, much like the
            newspaper. A completely news site would also be organized into
            sections such as news, sports and entertainment. News sites differ
            from other mediums because they have a greater responsibility to
            provide the latest news first becaue they don't have to wait until
            the broadcast like television, or wait until the next printing like
            newspaper. Because of this, journalists need to be sure they are
            still providing accurate news and not just jumping to get something
            up on their website.
